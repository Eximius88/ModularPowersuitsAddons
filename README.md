You MAY use this mod in any modpack that you wish. If people ask for your permissions, simply link them to this page.

QMX Note: This is a fork for RV1 bugfixes for Applied Energistics. Eximus88's fork is (seemingly supposed to be) the official fork (after Andrew2448 disappeared). Please submit any base bug reports there and only submit bug reports for Applied Energistics RV1 here. Thank you.

Note form Korynkai (2014-11-13): It now seems as though everything works as expected (including ME Wireless Terminal discharging the suit); This branch may be kept around to add additional fixes and new modules.
